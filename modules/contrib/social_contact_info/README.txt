INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Contact information provides an option to display contact and social
information in a block anywhere in your site.

We have given the contact fields like (e.g. Address, E-mail, Phone, Mobile,
and Fax) and social links fields like (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter,
Youtube, Google Plus, and Instagram).

Also, We have given an option to add custom contact title to the
contact information section and social media links too.

For contact details, We have made email field as required field and other all
the fields are optional fields. If you won't add any value to those fields
then those fields won't show on your site.

And for the label, If you won't add the label to those fields then the
fieldset/section will be displayed as a label.
